              I can remember, as a kid, watching <i>Pee-wee's Big Adventure</i>.
              Pee-wee starts his morning with a Rube Goldberg machine that ends
              with breakfast, and I was hooked. I knew for sure Iâ€™d grow up to
              be a mad scientist&mdash;like the dad from{" "}
              <i>Honey, I Shrunk the Kids</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
              I wanted to make things! Technology fascinated me. But as the
              years went by, my mad science dreams faded, replaced by a pull
              toward computers.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I discovered coding, the mad scientist in me whispered, "This
              is it&mdash;you can make anything here." And at the ripe age of
              28, I finally took the leap and started programming. I've never
              looked back.
            </p>
            <p>
              My journey began in 2017. I was studying finance (inspired by my
              short-lived forex trading adventure) and had just learned
              financial accounting. With this new knowledge, I figured it was
              time to grow up and finally make a budget. Little did I know, this
              would set me on a path to programming.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over time, I looked for ways to improve my system. How could I
              streamline it? Could I automate anything? It was time to finally
              get serious about it and learn to code. My budget was built in
              Excel, so naturally, I started with VBA. Cool&mdash;I had a form
              and a button now. But it wasn't enough; I wanted a completely
              custom, standalone budget app.
            </p>
            <p>
              Every new developer starts their journey by Googling, "What's the
              best programming language for newbies"&mdash;right? At least,
              that's what I did, and that's how I found Python. And so the obsession
              began. Mornings? Code time. Nights? Yeah&mdash;code time!
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, I'm studying computer science and working full-time as a
              process tech making plastic cups. I've learned Python, TypeScript,
              and Java.
            </p>
            <p>
              At night, I work on personal projects, from automation bots to
              full-stack web applications. My goal is to become a well-rounded
              developer capable of solving any problem (mad science optional).

              <i>Drive.</i> I remember my first experience with it: one morning,
              I sat down with my coffee, opened my IDE, and started coding. Next
              thing I knew, it was dark outside. Whoa! Twelve hours had
              vanished. Then another twelve hours disappeared. I knew, right then
              and there, programming was my calling. This quote perfectly
              describes my experience.

                  The challenge wasn't too easy. Nor was it too difficult. It
                  was a notch or two beyond his current abilities, which
                  stretched the body and mind in a way that made the effort
                  itself the most delicious reward. That balance produced a
                  degree of focus and satisfaction that easily surpassed other,
                  more quotidian, experiences. In flow, people lived so deeply
                  in the moment, and felt so utterly in control, that their
                  sense of time, place, and even self melted away.
